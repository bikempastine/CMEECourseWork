# Week 2: Python 1

### Description
This week focused on the basics of Python, including variables, data structures, loops, functions, control flow tools, debugging, list comprehensions, building modules, and more.

### Instructions
Run the code within the 'code' folder. The code may prompt for inputs. Appropriate example inputs can be found in the 'data' folder. The outupts of the code can be found in the 'results' folder once the code is run.
