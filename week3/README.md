# Week 3: R for Biological Computing

### Description
This week focused on the basics of R for biological computing.

### Instructions
Run the code within the 'code' folder. The code may prompt for inputs. Appropriate example inputs can be found in the 'data' folder. The outputs of the code can be found in the 'results' folder once the code is run.
